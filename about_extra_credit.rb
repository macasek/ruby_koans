# EXTRA CREDIT:
#
# Create a program that will play the Greed Game.
# Rules for the game are in GREED_RULES.TXT.
#
# You already have a DiceSet class and score function you can use.
# Write a player class and a Game class to complete the project.  This
# is a free form assignment, so approach it however you desire.

# MM - While it is true we already have a score function from a previous assignment
# as written it is really not ideal for this problem as we need to track unscored
# dice.
